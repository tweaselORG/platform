To Whom It May Concern:

I unfortunately had to notice that your Android app “Sample App”
(org.example.app) performs tracking data transmissions without consent.
I believe that this is in violation of applicable data protection law.

Please refer to the attached notice and technical report for further
details. Please especially note the voluntary 60 day grace period that I
am giving you before filing a complaint with the data protection
authorities.

Yours sincerely,
me
